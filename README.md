## Create Your First React Project
React is a popular JavaScript library used for front-end development projects. React was released by facaebook and is used to create beautiful and interactive User Interfaces.

React is component based which means that React divides the user interface into reusable pieces of code called components and one can have as many components as necessary.

To create your first React project, you will need to initialize your React app with an npx comand on your terminal. This will create a folder that contains the necessary setup to run your react app.
