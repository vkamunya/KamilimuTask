## Create Your First React Project
React is a popular JavaScript library used for front-end development projects. React was released by facaebook and is used to create beautiful and interactive User Interfaces.

React is component based which means that React divides the user interface into reusable pieces of code called components and one can have as many components as necessary.

To create your first React project on your terminal, first navigate to the folder where you want to create your app.
You will need to initialize your React app with an npx comand on your terminal. This will create a folder that contains the necessary setup to run your react app.

The npx command should be followed by the name you want to call your React Application. Allow some time for the project to build.
